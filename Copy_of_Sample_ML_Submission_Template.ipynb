        "The project aimed to analyze and predict stock prices using time series analysis and machine learning techniques. The dataset consisted of historical stock prices for a particular company, including features such as date, open, high, low, and close prices. The goal was to build a model that could accurately predict future stock prices based on past data, enabling investors and traders to make informed decisions.\n",
        "\n",
        "The project began with data exploration and preprocessing steps. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) revealed insights into the structure and distribution of the dataset, identifying any missing values, duplicates, or outliers. Data preprocessing involved handling missing values, converting data types, and scaling the data using log transformation to ensure that the models perform optimally.\n",
        "\n",
        "After preprocessing, the dataset was split into training and testing sets for model training and evaluation. Three different regression models were considered: Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, and Random Forest Regression. Each model was trained on the training data and evaluated using various performance metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared.\n",
        "\n",
        "The results of the modeling phase indicated that the Linear Regression model outperformed the other models, achieving the lowest MSE, MAE, and highest R-squared values. This suggested that the Linear Regression model provided the best fit to the data and yielded the most accurate predictions. However, Lasso Regression and Random Forest Regression also performed reasonably well, demonstrating the potential of different regression techniques for predicting stock prices.\n",
        "\n",
        "To further improve the performance of the models, hyperparameter tuning was performed on the Random Forest Regression model using techniques such as grid search or random search. This optimization process helped fine-tune the model's parameters and improve its predictive accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, the best performing model (Linear Regression) was saved using Joblib for future deployment. Predictions were made on unseen data to validate the model's generalization ability and ensure its reliability in real-world scenarios.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, the project successfully demonstrated the application of time series analysis and machine learning techniques for stock price prediction. The use of regression models allowed for accurate forecasting of future stock prices based on historical data, providing valuable insights for investors and traders. Future work could involve exploring more advanced modeling techniques, incorporating additional features or external data sources, and deploying the model in a real-time trading environment to evaluate its performance in practice."

        "Yes Bank is a well-known bank in the Indian financial domain. Since 2018, it has been in the news because of the fraud case involving Rana Kapoor. Owing to this fact, it was interesting to see how that impacted the stock prices of the company and whether Time series models or any other predictive models can do justice to such situations. This dataset has monthly stock prices of the bank since its inception and includes closing, starting, highest, and lowest stock prices of every month. The main objective is to predict the stock’s closing price of the month.\n"

It assumes that the relationship between the features and the target variable is linear and additive.\n",
